	XML was designed to be both human- and machine-readable.
	
	XML is used in many aspects of web development.

	XML is often used to separate data from presentation.

What is XPath?
	XPath is a major element in the XSLT standard.
	XPath can be used to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document.
	
	XPath uses path expressions to select nodes or node-sets in an XML document. These path expressions look very much like the expressions you see when you work with a traditional computer file system.

	XPath expressions can be used in JavaScript, Java, XML Schema, PHP, Python, C and C++, and lots of other languages.
